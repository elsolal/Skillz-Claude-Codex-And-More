# D-EPCT+R Workflow

> Skills Claude Code pour un workflow de développement structuré — du brainstorm au déploiement.

An orchestrator-based workflow that guides you through the full development lifecycle across Claude Code, Codex, Gemini, OpenCode, and generic agents.

```
/discovery → /dev → /ship
```

---

## Features

- **Orchestrator pattern** — the main thread keeps full context across all phases. Only mechanical work (code, tests, reviews, issue creation) is dispatched to parallel subagents.
- **Three-command workflow** — `/discovery` for planning, `/dev` for implementation, `/ship` for delivery.
- **Autonomous mode (RALPH)** — `/auto-discovery`, `/auto-dev`, `/auto-loop` run the same workflows without validation stops, with safety gates to prevent runaway execution.
- **Multi-provider** — one source of truth in `.claude/`, mirrored into Codex, Gemini, OpenCode, and generic agent folders.
- **Design audit loop** — `/design-audit` gates UI/design-system work with tokens, components, stories/docs, a11y, taste, Figma/code drift, AI governance, and optional Lyse evidence; `/design-audit-squad` runs the full 12-agent Lyse Design Squad.
- **SEO/GEO audit workflow** — `/seo-geo-audit` audits technical SEO, content, SERP intent, authority, local SEO, llms.txt and AI visibility; `/seo-geo-squad` runs the full 11-agent Roso SEO Squad.
- **Web navigation layer** — `web-navigator` lets agents browse, inspect, extract and source information from real sites using Playwright CLI, Browser/MCP or WebFetch fallbacks.
- **50+ skills** — planning (PRD, architecture, stories), critical thinking (Rodin), design (UX, UI, Figma integration), development (code, tests, review, security, performance), audio/video (ElevenLabs, Remotion).
- **48 knowledge files** — testing frameworks, workflow templates, brainstorming techniques, Supabase security.
- **Multi-Mind debate** — 6 AI agents (Claude, GPT, Gemini, DeepSeek, GLM, Kimi) validate PRDs and code through 5 iterative rounds.
- **Obsidian LLM Wiki** — optional second-brain memory that compounds across sessions. One-command bootstrap with `bash install.sh install all --with-wiki` or the `/wiki-bootstrap` slash command. See [the dedicated section below](#obsidian-llm-wiki--second-brain-memory).

## Installation

### Global (everywhere)

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/elsolal/Skillz-Claude-Codex-And-More/main/install.sh | bash -s -- install all
```

Installs into `~/.claude/`, `~/.codex/`, `~/.gemini/`, `~/.config/opencode/`, and `~/.agents/`. Claude is the source of truth; the others mirror it.

### Per-project

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/elsolal/Skillz-Claude-Codex-And-More/main/install.sh | bash -s -- install .
```

Creates `.claude/`, `.codex/`, `.gemini/`, `.opencode/`, `.agents/`, and `docs/` inside the current repository.

### Update

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/elsolal/Skillz-Claude-Codex-And-More/main/install.sh | bash -s -- update all
```

Your provider config is preserved. The installer only refreshes the managed workflow section and adds the `qmd` MCP entry if it is missing.

<details>
<summary><strong>Install one provider at a time</strong></summary>

Claude must be installed first since the other providers mirror it.

```bash
# Global
./install.sh install claude
./install.sh install codex      # after Claude
./install.sh install gemini     # after Claude
./install.sh install opencode   # after Claude
./install.sh install agents     # after Claude

# Per-project — picks the providers you want
./install.sh install . --providers claude
./install.sh install . --providers codex,gemini
./install.sh install . --providers opencode
```

| Provider | Installed into | What you get |
|---|---|---|
| Claude Code | `~/.claude/` | Full skills, all Claude slash commands, knowledge, templates |
| OpenAI Codex CLI | `~/.codex/` | Skill symlinks, Codex-native prompts, generated wiki `source-command-*` skills, generated `AGENTS.md` |
| Google Gemini CLI | `~/.gemini/` | Skill symlinks, Gemini-native commands, generated `GEMINI.md` |
| OpenCode | `~/.config/opencode/` | Skill symlinks, OpenCode-native commands, generated `AGENTS.md` |
| Generic agents | `~/.agents/` | Skill symlinks and generated `AGENTS.md` |

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Update and uninstall</strong></summary>

```bash
# Update
./install.sh update all
./install.sh update claude
./install.sh update codex
./install.sh update gemini
./install.sh update opencode
./install.sh update agents

# Uninstall (keeps user-added content)
./install.sh uninstall all
./install.sh uninstall claude
./install.sh uninstall codex
./install.sh uninstall gemini
./install.sh uninstall opencode
./install.sh uninstall agents

# Per-project update
./install.sh update . --providers all
./install.sh update . --providers codex,gemini

# Help
./install.sh help
```

Drift protection: `~/.claude/.skillz-manifest` tracks skills and Claude commands installed by Skillz. During updates, items previously managed by Skillz but no longer in the source are removed. User-added skills are not touched.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Provider-native packages (Claude plugin, Gemini extension)</strong></summary>

Use these only when you explicitly want a provider package instead of the universal installer.

| Provider | Command | Scope |
|---|---|---|
| Claude Code | `claude --plugin-dir /path/to/Skillz-Claude-Codex-And-More` | Loads the plugin from `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`. |
| Gemini CLI | `gemini --extension-dir /path/to/Skillz-Claude-Codex-And-More/.gemini` | Loads Gemini-native TOML commands plus `.gemini/GEMINI.md`. |
| OpenCode | `./install.sh install opencode` | No bundled JS/TS plugin yet — use the universal installer. |

```bash
gh repo clone elsolal/Skillz-Claude-Codex-And-More

# Claude Code plugin
claude --plugin-dir ./Skillz-Claude-Codex-And-More

# Gemini CLI extension
gemini --extension-dir ./Skillz-Claude-Codex-And-More/.gemini
```

Reload skills with `/reload-plugins` (Claude Code) or restart your agent after manifest changes.

</details>

Diagnostic: `/skillz-doctor` (v5.8.0+) and autonomous safety gates (v5.7.0+) are documented in [CHANGELOG.md](./CHANGELOG.md).

### Optional: Playwright CLI for agent navigation

Playwright automates real browsers. Installing `@playwright/cli` gives AI agents a terminal-driven way to open a product or public site, click through flows, fill forms, inspect console/network errors, resize viewports, capture screenshots and extract grounded information. Skillz-Claude routes this through `web-navigator`, then QA, SEO/GEO, design and test skills consume the same evidence.

```bash
npm install -g @playwright/cli@latest
playwright-cli install --skills
playwright-cli --help
```

Use it with `web-navigator`, `/qa`, `seo-geo-audit`, `test-runner` and `design-audit` when you want runtime evidence from a local, preview, staging or production URL. `playwright-cli install --skills` installs the companion skills for Claude by default; use `playwright-cli install --skills=agents` for generic agent skills.

## Obsidian LLM Wiki — second-brain memory

A persistent, interlinked knowledge base that grows across sessions, inspired by [Karpathy's LLM Wiki pattern](https://gist.github.com/karpathy/442a6bf555914893e9891c11519de94f). Sources are read once, integrated into a shared Obsidian vault, kept up to date by the agent. The agent reads `wiki/index.md` first, drills into pages, and synthesizes answers — instead of re-deriving everything via RAG on every query.

> **Built on top of [`alirezarezvani/claude-skills`](https://github.com/alirezarezvani/claude-skills) (MIT) — see [`skills/ATTRIBUTION.md`](./skills/ATTRIBUTION.md).**

### One-command install

```bash
bash install.sh install all --with-wiki
```

This runs the standard install **and** bootstraps the wiki: it asks for the vault path, creates the structure, patches `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`, checks `qmd`, creates or refreshes a named QMD collection, and runs a health check. Skip the bootstrap with `--no-wiki`. Re-run anytime with `bash scripts/setup-wiki.sh` (idempotent).

### Prerequisites

| Tool | Required | Install | Why |
|------|----------|---------|-----|
| **Obsidian** | Yes | [obsidian.md/download](https://obsidian.md/download) (free) | Editor for the vault. Open the chosen folder as a vault inside Obsidian after bootstrap. |
| **Python 3.9+** | Yes | already required by Skillz-Claude | Powers `init_vault.py`, `lint_wiki.py`, `wiki_search.py`. Stdlib only — no pip install. |
| **`qmd` CLI** | Recommended | `npm install -g @tobilu/qmd` with Node 22+, or `bun install -g @tobilu/qmd`; see [tobi/qmd](https://github.com/tobi/qmd) | Local vector search across the vault for when the index alone is not enough. The setup script warns but does not block if absent. |

### What the bootstrap does

1. **Detects an existing vault** — parses `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` for a previous `Vault memoire :` line. Reuses it if found.
2. **Creates the vault** at the chosen path (default `~/Documents/Obsidian-<git-user>/Wiki`) with the three-layer structure (`raw/`, `wiki/{entities,concepts,sources,comparisons,synthesis}`, `index.md`, `log.md`).
3. **Patches `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`** with an idempotent `<!-- BEGIN:llm-wiki-config --> … <!-- END:llm-wiki-config -->` block so every new Claude session knows where the vault lives and how to use it.
4. **Verifies the `qmd` binary** is on your PATH (warns if not).
5. **Optionally creates or refreshes the QMD collection** for `wiki/` (`--with-qmd` to force, prompted in interactive mode), then runs `qmd update` and `qmd embed`.
6. **Smoke-tests** the vault with `lint_wiki.py` (orphans, broken links, frontmatter, log gap).

### QMD MCP across agents

`install/update all` now ensures the local QMD MCP server is available in the three agent clients used by this setup:

| Client | Config file | QMD server entry |
|---|---|---|
| Claude Code | project `.mcp.json` and Skillz `.claude/mcp.json` | `"qmd": { "command": "qmd", "args": ["mcp"] }` |
| Codex | `~/.codex/config.toml` | `[mcp_servers.qmd]` with `command = "qmd"` and `args = ["mcp"]` |
| OpenCode | `~/.config/opencode/opencode.json` | `"qmd": { "type": "local", "command": ["qmd", "mcp"], "enabled": true }` |

The installer only adds QMD if it is missing. Existing MCP servers stay in place.

### Local project memory pointers

Project repos should not commit machine-specific memory paths. For shared teams, publish the memory vault repo and QMD collection name, then let each collaborator create local pointers:

```bash
scripts/create-project-memory-pointer.sh \
  --project-dir /path/to/project-repo \
  --project-name project-repo \
  --vault-path "$OBSIDIAN_MEMORY_ROOT/Pleepole" \
  --memory-repo https://github.com/Pleepole/pleepole-memory.git \
  --qmd-collection pleepole-wiki \
  --start-page wiki/index.md
```

The helper writes `.claude/project-memory.md` and `.agents/project-memory.md`, then protects them with `.git/info/exclude`. These files can contain absolute local paths and must stay out of commits.

### Open the vault in Obsidian

After bootstrap:

1. Launch Obsidian.
2. Click **Open folder as vault** and pick the path printed by the script (default: `~/Documents/Obsidian-<your-name>/Wiki`).
3. The vault is now your second brain — but most of the time you will not edit it manually. Use the slash commands below.

### Commands available after install

```
/wiki-bootstrap              Re-run or repair the install (interactive).
/wiki-init <path> --topic …  Create a brand new empty vault (no CLAUDE.md patching).
/wiki-ingest <file>          Ingest a source from raw/ into the wiki, update cross-references.
/wiki-query "<question>"     Ask the wiki — agent drills into 3-10 pages and answers with [[wikilinks]].
/wiki-lint                   Health check: orphans, broken links, stale pages, log gap.
/wiki-log                    Show recent log entries (decisions, ingests).
/wiki-capture-session [topic] Capture durable notes from the current chat into raw/ for later /wiki-ingest.
```

Codex note: Codex does not reliably consume Claude slash command files directly. `install/update codex` generates Codex-only skills like `source-command-wiki-capture-session` in `~/.codex/skills/`, so natural triggers such as `/wiki-capture-session` or "capture cette session dans le wiki" load the right workflow after restarting Codex. OpenCode keeps using its native command folder.

### Manual / advanced flags

```bash
bash scripts/setup-wiki.sh                       # interactive
bash scripts/setup-wiki.sh --vault ~/path        # explicit vault path
bash scripts/setup-wiki.sh --verify              # health check only, no writes
bash scripts/setup-wiki.sh --with-qmd            # update qmd collection and embeddings
bash scripts/setup-wiki.sh --qmd-collection name # explicit qmd collection name
bash scripts/setup-wiki.sh --no-qmd              # skip qmd entirely
bash scripts/setup-wiki.sh --non-interactive     # CI mode, fails if config missing
```

### What never goes in the wiki

Secrets, tokens, credentials, full logs, raw transcripts, stack traces. The wiki is for durable knowledge — decisions, conventions, sources, syntheses. The codebase remains the immediate source of truth.

---

## Quick Start

### 1. New idea → full planning

```
/discovery
> "I want to build a personal expense tracker with categories and budget alerts"
```

The orchestrator guides you through Brainstorm → PRD → Architecture → Stories → GitHub Issues. You validate at each checkpoint.

### 2. Implement an existing issue

```
/dev #123
```

The orchestrator explores the codebase, plans the implementation, then dispatches Code + Tests to 2 parallel subagents and Review ×3 to 3 parallel subagents.

### 3. Autonomous mode (RALPH)

```
/auto-discovery "Personal expense tracker app"
/auto-dev #123
```

Same workflows, zero validation stops. Claude works autonomously until completion.

### 4. Ship it

```
/ship
```

Merges main, runs tests, pre-landing review, generates changelog, creates PR.

## Rodin Socratic Challenge

Rodin is the lightweight anti-echo pass for plans, PRDs, architecture choices, product strategy, and agent reasoning. It is read-only by design: it challenges the decision before implementation instead of editing files or replacing `/dev`, `/plan-review`, or `multi-mind`.

> **Inspired by Benjamin Debon's [`rodin.md`](https://gist.github.com/bdebon/e22d0b728abc5f393227440907b334cf) anti-echo prompt — adapted into a Skillz-Claude read-only agent workflow. See [`skills/ATTRIBUTION.md`](./skills/ATTRIBUTION.md).**

```bash
/rodin "On devrait ajouter ce nouveau workflow parce que..."
/rodin docs/planning/specs/2026-05-22-feature-design.md
/rodin https://example.com/strategy-note.md
```

Rodin outputs a structured review:

- **These testee** — the real claim or decision being made.
- **Steelman** — the strongest charitable version of the position.
- **Points classes** — `JUSTE`, `CONTESTABLE`, `SIMPLIFICATION`, `ANGLE MORT`, or `FAUX` where it matters.
- **Objections fortes** — the objections that would actually change the decision.
- **Tests de realite** — concrete checks before committing to the plan.
- **Verdict** — hold, modify, reject, or suspend pending evidence.

Use Rodin when the risk is bad reasoning. Use `/plan-review` when you need founder-mode scope arbitration, `code-reviewer` when reviewing code, and `multi-mind` when a critical decision deserves a heavier multi-agent debate.

---

## Architecture

The orchestrator (main thread) keeps ALL context. It never forks to isolated skills for planning. Only execution (code, tests, reviews, issue creation) is dispatched to subagents via `SendMessage`.

**Frontend-aware:** after Explore, the workflow auto-detects frontend work (Figma URLs, `.tsx` files, `components/CLAUDE.md`) and prioritizes component reuse, token usage, and Figma mapping. After implementation, it proposes `/ds-doc --update` to keep design system documentation in sync.

## Multi-Mind Debate

6 AI agents debate to validate PRDs and code through 5 rounds: Critique → Frictions → Debate → Convergence → Consensus.

```bash
/multi-mind prd docs/PRD/PRD-Feature.md    # Validate a PRD
/multi-mind review src/components/Auth.tsx  # Multi-perspective review
```

| Agent | Provider | Role | Cost |
|---|---|---|---|
| Claude | Anthropic | Prudent Architect | Included |
| GPT | OpenAI | Perfectionist | Paid |
| Gemini | Google | UX Innovator | Paid |
| DeepSeek | DeepSeek | Provocateur | Free |
| GLM | Zhipu AI | Frontend Craftsman | Free |
| Kimi | Moonshot | Product Thinker | Free |

Setup: create `.env.local` with API keys (see `.env.example`). Minimum 3 agents for a valid debate.

## Multi-Agent Compatibility

Works with Claude Code, OpenAI Codex CLI, Google Gemini CLI, OpenCode, and generic agents. `.agents/`, `.codex/`, `.gemini/`, and `.opencode/` mirror `.claude/` as the single source of truth, while provider-native command files live in each provider folder.
